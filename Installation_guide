To install Terraform on Windows, it is preferable to use 'Chocolatey' using PowerShell/Git-bash.
Chocolatey is a package manager that automates the installation process on Windows systems.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Installation :-

a) Open PowerShell in Search icon...
b) Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu.
c) Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select Run as Administrator.
d) Ensure Chocolatey is Installed:

If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you must install it first.
Copy and paste the following script into the administrative PowerShell window and press Enter:-

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

To verify the installation, close and reopen PowerShell as an Administrator, then run choco version.

Install Terraform:
In the administrative PowerShell window, run the following command to install the latest version of Terraform:

choco install terraform -y (The -y flag automatically approves all confirmation prompts)

Verify the Installation:

Close and reopen your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) to ensure the system's PATH environment variable is updated.

Run the following command to check the installed version:

terraform version

You should see output displaying the installed Terraform version, confirming a successful installation.
